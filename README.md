# Password Generator and Encryptor

Passwords are an integral part in the world of Computer Science.  
This project aims to generate and encrypt passwords for the user using Python.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- The program will run without any issues on any computer, but for a good experience, it is recommended to use a system with atleast 4 GB memory, and atleast 2 CPU cores.
- Python must be installed along with the cryptography and tkinter modules.
- You can use git to clone the repository, or you can download the zip file.

### Basic Setup


- Start the app with the following command :

```
python3 gui.py
```
- Encrypt and decrypt the password inputted by running :

```
python3 main.py
```

### Technologies Used

- All the visuals were built solely using ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-%2314354C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white) 
- [**Tkinter**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) and [**Cryptography**](https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/) were the libraries used to create the project.
